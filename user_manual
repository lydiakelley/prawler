How to turn on, run, and retrieve data from the sensor
Plug the lithium battery into the microcontroller. 
Check to see that the blue light on the microcontroller is turning on and off, else it is not collecting data properly.
Slide the microcontroller and battery into the microcontroller frame.
Put the frame and the clock sensor inside the electronics housing and seal the housing so it is waterproof. 
Put the electronics housing inside of the hose rings and screw the rings tight. 
Attach the pressure/temperature and light sensor to the top of the vechicle and make sure that the light sensor is facing up.
Adjust the cam mechanism so that the inner tube is pushed down so that the instrument will start in a downwards crawl.
Now the instrument is ready to deploy in the field. 
Drop the weight in first and then slowly lower the instrument. 
Once you are done with the deploymen and have retrieved the instrument, you'll want to open the electronics housing. 
Unplug the lithium battery when the blue light is turned off so that the data will finish saving.
Using a USB cord, connect your computer to the microcontroller and download the data.
